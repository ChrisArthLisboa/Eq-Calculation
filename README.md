# Eq-Calculation

A calculator and graph creator made in C;

Made for a school project.

The pbPlot.h and the supportLib.h were modified by me, I just took all supportLib functions and threw them all in the end of the pbPlot

to run it you'll need to run `gcc -o archive.c pbPlot.h supportLib.h` on the terminal
